# PROI_proj1_zbiory
My very first project in C++ as part of the Object Programming Course at the 2nd semester of the Computer Science degree at Warsaw University of Technology

It allows to perform some of the basic operations at the sets containing points in a cartesian landmark.

The implemented operations include: sets' union, sets' intersection, determining the nearest points in each set, adding points to the set
